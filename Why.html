    <h1>Why do I do this?</h1>
    <hr size="2"noshade>
    <h3>Beginning</h3>
    <p>Over and over again I begin same things from the start. I can't complete anything, and I can't keep working on the things I start.
      This makes me really depressed. I always think about what would have happened if I had completed at least one course I started. But all
      of that are just dreams.</p>
    <h3>Dreams</h3>
    <p>Dreams can come true if you pursue them with all of your heart and strenght. But I only look at them from distance and never come closer.
    Moreover, it seems that I flow down the river with the high speed to the waterfall from where I won't be able to look at my dreams anymore.
    Every time I try to make a step towards a river bank, trying to pull myself out of it, I face big difficulty.</p>
    <h3>Difficulty</h3>
    <p>
      It is difficult to be consistent in your words and doings. Everytime I give myself a word to keep doing something, there are 1000 of words
      not to do that. Same thing over and over, no matter what I start to do. Only strong motivation can break it. But how do I find one that will be
      actual during long period of time?
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Money always were a big cult in my family. Everything was about a money. It seems that my lifestyle is also about a money. I am not used to
    spend money on myself even when I started to earn some money myself. Only necessary things essential for surviving and social acceptance. Even now
    when I have a family, i can spend some money on games only. Not without a guilt. And these things controversial. I can't earn money without purpose.
    I found one, to earn money to buy bigger house, car better environment for my family. Will it be enough though?</p>
    <h3>Better life for my family</h3>
    <p>
      At the moment I started this course because I see no future in my current position as technical support, I don't like it, I always wanted to make things
      and I want much bigger salary than I have now. It is necessary to get enough money for the house, for better life to all of my family.
      But most important it will show if I am capable to complete anything at all in my 30-ties. Read it, feel it. Make a choice.
